Hi! I'm Fiorella. This is my **personal website**.
My work focuses on community ecology, macroecological patterns, and biodiversity conservation. I am a research associate at the Natural History Museum of the National University of San Agustín (Peru), a member of the Global Tree Specialist Group and the Species Survival Commission (SSC) at the UICN. Currently, as a model for research, I work on dry ecosystems such as coastal lomas.
